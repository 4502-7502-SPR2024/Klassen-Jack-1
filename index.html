<!— (Overall, I am happy with how my final website turned out. I feel like I have come a long way since I first started this course. In the beginning, I felt confused and lost when it came to coding. The first couple of HTML pages we turned in I felt really confused. But once I got the hang of how to code and how to maneuver within Sublime I realized that it wasn’t that tricky. Learning CSS was difficult at first because I didn’t know how to have the CSS change the text and colors of my HTML pages. The tutorials that we did throughout the semester on both HTML and CSS really helped me to get a grasp on this. In the end, I am really happy with how my final project turned out. It was a culmination of a lot of hard work and patience. I like the color design I chose for my pages as well as the navigation. I feel like the colors I chose aren’t too harsh on the eyes which I believed to be important. I also wanted the navigation to be simple that way it was easy to move from one page to the next. If you had told me at the beginning of the semester that I would be able to design a website that looks like this I wouldn’t have believed you. Not to mention, all of the feedback that you gave me throughout the semester was super helpful and informative. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and I think that I learned some skills that I will be able to apply in the future.) —>
